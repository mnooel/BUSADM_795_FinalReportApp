    <h3>Data Focus</h3>
    <p>
        The majority of Core Creativeâ€™s revenue is derived from billing employee time back to clients. Our focus
        included the investigation of the relationship between these two sets of data.

    <h3>Data Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        Initially it was thought that utilizing a database for our analysis would provide ease and usability along with
        the sheer volume of data and relationships that only a database can provide. However, as we continued our
        analysis, we discovered that it is increasingly difficult to access and use data therein. Locating important
        data points within 726 tables became time consuming and tedious. It also took a substantial amount of time to
        code and test the acquisition engines to run the migration. However, since the objective of our research was to
        investigate the potential of data science to make prediction at an advertising agency, we do find this practice
        useful. If automation of analysis is to happen, the use of database queries for analysis is necessary.
