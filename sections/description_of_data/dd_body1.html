    <h3>Data Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Core Creative utilizes an ERP system designed for agencies called Workamajig. The benefit of using an ERP system
        for Core Creative and for our analysis is centralization of data in a structured format. Information related to
        clients, employees, projects, budgets, timesheets, costs, employee comments, conversations, and the general
        ledger call be accessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Workamajig stores this information on a Microsoft SQL database. We obtained the credentials for a read-only user
        to that database as well as the DNS variables required for a connection. Initial examination of the metadata
        reveled the existence of 465 tables and 261 pre-joined view tables.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Acquisition</h3>
    <p>
        Due to the fact that the database is live and actively used by Core Creative we determined that it was necessary
        to obtain a static copy of the data for our analysis for the stability of our research. We conducted something
        of a soft migration of the hosted database to a local environment to achieve this by utilizing the Pandas and
        SQLAlchemy Python packages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Pandas package creates and modifies dataframes in a fashion very similar to R. SQLAlchemy is an object
        relational mapper package used to make connections with databases and define tables in an object-oriented
        fashion, since Python is an object-oriented language. We used SQLAlchemy to create an object called an engine.
        This engine translates the commands of the python scrip to the language of the specified database. For ease, we
        decided to migrate to a SQLite format locally since the database is stored as a file in a directory. Because the
        database type of hosted source database deferred from the type we were to utilize locally, we created a base
        engine class that takes certain DNS parameters to create an engine like object. This base engine contained
        methods needed for both database types. We could then subclass the base engine to two separate classes for the
        source database and the local lite database, each with their own distinct methods.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Focus</h3>
    <p>
        The majority of Core Creativeâ€™s revenue is derived from billing employee time back to clients. Our focus
        included the investigation of the relationship between these two sets of data.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        Initially it was thought that utilizing a database for our analysis would provide ease and usability along with
        the sheer volume of data and relationships that only a database can provide. However, as we continued our
        analysis, we discovered that it is increasingly difficult to access and use data therein. Locating important
        data points within 726 tables became time consuming and tedious. It also took a substantial amount of time to
        code and test the acquisition engines to run the migration. However, since the objective of our research was to
        investigate the potential of data science to make prediction at an advertising agency, we do find this practice
        useful. If automation of analysis is to happen, the use of database queries for analysis is necessary.
