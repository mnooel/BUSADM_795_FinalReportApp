        The SQL database maintained by Core Creative is vast and contains many data points. Accessing the database and
        developing a useful process to analyze it was a challenge. Beyond access, determining which data in the database
        was relevant to our problem of predicting revenue is the single biggest challenge we faced. This large amount of
        information is not unique in data science. We believe this to be a problem many data scientists face when
        solving a problem or creating predictions toward a particular goal.

        The process we developed for determining which subset of data may be most relevant to our goal, did not include
        a computational or data analytics component initially. Rather, we consulted with several employees at Core
        Creative to understand how they are currently predicting monthly revenue. Mike, his boss, and several other
        members of Core Creative are involved in the revenue analysis each month. Their intimate knowledge of the
        various data that is currently used to project monthly financials served as starting point for this analysis.
        The process ultimately led to a set of variables we tested with our models and eventually narrowed further.

        It is not unfair to assume that we may have omitted some relevant variables in our analysis that were in the
        Enterprise Resource Planning database we accessed. More time and expertise from Core Creative employees would
        enable us to perform stronger analyses. Other data sources exist beyond Core Creative’s ERP system and access to
        these would likely improve our models’ prediction capability.

        The models we chose, linear regression and neural network, are certainly not the only choice of models we could
        implement. Additional data regarding the sales pipeline, type of client, client interactions, and account
        manager competency are examples of information that would enable further analysis and possibly better model the
        revenue changes for a given period. Though other techniques could be incorporated to improve the model, given
        the data available to us, we still feel our modelling choices are reasonable. Below we will describe the
        approach and process we undertook to implement our models and evaluate their performance.
