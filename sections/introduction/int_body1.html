    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        This report was written completely in R, Python, html, and css.
        The R language includes an installable package called <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/"
                                                                 target="_blank">Shiny</a>.
        Shiny is a package that include objects and methods that render live html to a webpage.
        An application file is run on the R kernel in a while loop that acts as a server.
        Users can interact with filters, selectors, and sliders to modify the inputs to functions defined in the app.R
        file.
        The functions then render new plots based on the input.

        The top bar of the report detailing the Executive Summary to the References is actually an html navbar.
        Click on the different sections to view them.
        Hyperlinks can be clicked on within the report to reference external documentation or sources.

        Hopefully this report will shine some light onto the wonderful powers that R has to offer by presenting our research in this format.
        We had a lot of fun creating our report/application, and hope you have just as much reading it.
