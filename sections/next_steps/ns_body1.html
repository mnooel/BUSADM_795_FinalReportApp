    <h3>Sales Pipeline Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        We recognize that our predictions may be limited by the data available to us in this project and the model
        constructed. Therefore, a more robust analysis would incorporate additional data sources and likely require
        different modeling techniques. Core Creative uses Salesforce to manage client relationships and track potential
        sales. This data is currently housed only in the Salesforce application that Core Creative uses. Including this
        data with the ERP database could lead to a much better analysis of revenue and increase the accuracy of
        projections. Though the difficulty in creating an automated way to access the data would be great. Additional
        information held in Salesforce includes, client communication logs, and sales opportunities for new sales
        activities. Also, the use of the sales pipeline module in the existing ERP system would be recommended. This
        could help shine light on the future of organic sales with current clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our recommendation would be to incorporate Salesforce data into a database with the ERP data. Using these data
        sources in tandem could enable interesting analysis. For example, client communication logs could be analyzed
        using natural language processing though a software like OpenNLP which has an interface for R (Choudhury, 2020).
        Combining insights from the communication logs, the Salesforce sales pipeline, and the ERP system pipeline would
        help pinpoint more precisely when a potential sale is going to close.

    <p>
        An analysis such as this would move beyond time series forecast and linear regression and likely incorporate
        logistic regression. Logistic regression could predict the probability of a client sale being recognized in a
        given month. Understanding when a potential sale is going to close is a key aspect, in addition to measuring
        recurring revenue, for predicting next month’s revenue.

    <h3>Division of Financial Data by Other Entity</h3>
    <p>
        There are many other entities at core creative that drive revenue. Our analysis took a look solely at the
        financial side of the data with divisions of new business efforts and employee load balance of billable and
        unbillable. Clients, projects, project types, and employees could all be clustered based on aggregated data for
        each type of entity. The database houses the relational data needed to the split financial information based on
        the three clusters found. This division of financial information would multiple the number of data points
        observed by the number of clusters. It’s unknown if this type of analysis would prove fruitful but it can be
        done <- aaron please reword if you get what I am saying.
    </p>
    <p>
        Project types, clients, employees, project, salesforce data (pipeline)/opportunities, comment records, client
        communications logs (NLP), could each be individually examined to see how they influence forecasting.
