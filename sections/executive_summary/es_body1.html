    <h3>Overview of Issue</h3>
    <p>
        Advertising agencies are quite volatile and chaotic organizations.
        Often agencies are juggling multiple clients who have razor thin margins but still expect a dollar for the price
        of a dime.
        If that client represented a significant portion of the business trouble for the agency is soon to follow.
        But there is not always a direct line of sight in to financial well being of agency.
        Owners and managers look to the insights that financial professionals can pull from their data to help drive
        decisions that leave the agency in a better place.
