        Primary Objective
    </h3>
    <p>
        The primary objective of this study is to explore the capabilities of data science techniques to forecast
        revenue based on financial data of an advertising agency. To do this, we utilize the data of the local
        advertising agency Core Creative.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Secondary Objectives
    </h3>
    <p>
        Secondary objectives of this study involve exploring the capabilities of data science techniques to predicting
        other facets of an advertising agency, again using the data of Core Creative. These other facets might provide
        predictive capabilities that can be utilized to extrapolate revenue forecasting beyond financial information
        data sets.

    <h3>
        Overview of Core Creative
    </h3>
    <p>
        Core Creative is a full-service branding agency located in the fifth ward of Milwaukee. Their service offerings
        include public relations, digital advertising, traditional media buying, brand definition services, website
        development, and design services. Core Creative’s clients come from all across the nation. Most of their client
        base is in the Midwest, with a large percent of that base located in the greater Milwaukee area. However, they
        do have a substantial number of clients that are located on the East Coast.
    </p>
    <p>
        Almost all the work performed for Core Creative clients is on a in progress time and material project basis.
        Throughout the month employee hours are logged to projects, and costs are classified on the general ledger if
        they relate to a project. Revenue is then generated by billing back employee hours and project costs to the
        client at a negotiated rate per employee service activity hour and markup per cost. It is very rare to see a
        fixed fee billing structure negotiated with a client at Core Creative.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Issues Surrounding the Objectives
    </h3>
    <p>
        The advertising industry is very volatile. Historically core creative experiences a 20% turnover in their client
        base per year. This is consistent with the industry average. This problem is compounded by the substantial costs
        to court and close a new client. It often requires substantial investment of time and money to sign a new
        client. But even at that time there is no contractual obligation for the client to stay with Core Creative. A
        new business investment might be made to close the deal, only to see that client leave after a small amount of
        project work. Again, this is consistent with industry standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Client demands also make it very difficult to do business in the advertising industry. Clients often want
        something yesterday for a dollar cheaper than it should be. This is to say, that often a client does not look at
        their agency of record as a partner, but more so as a vendor. However, the development of complex and
        strategical advertising plans requires such a partnership. Some projects present unique challenges not foreseen
        in the initial project budget and require additional time and money from Core Creative. This often leads to
        write offs when the client does not put in the effort needed to maintain a partnership with Core Creative.
    </p>
    <p>
        This high paced and volatile environment is not conducive to standard or simple analytical procedures. Factors
        of inputs change constantly and need to be adjusted. There is often a lot of information about what is going on,
        but no one has the time to sit down and really dig through it. Additionally, there is not a robust process to
        examine these changing conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is where data science comes in. The initial development of data science and programming applications can
        take time, money, and effort. However, the process can be automated to an extent and can allow for a deeper
        analysis of the financial relationship between Core Creative and the company’s clients. Data science enables
        decision makers to identify which inputs are most relevant to Core Creative’s revenue and financial health
        across the client base and can determine the relative importance of each of those variables. This in turn, can
        drive decisions that optimize Core Creative’s client relationships, revenue, and employee utilization.
