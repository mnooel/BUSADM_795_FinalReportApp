    <h3>Neural Network Model</h3>
    <p>
        The linear models we tested were less predictive than we hoped so we decided to try a neural network model using
        the neuralnet package in R. For this model we decided again to lag the independent variables using the Hmisc
        package and create indicator variables for each month.
    </p>
    <p>
        To begin with, we used the same 6 predictor variables that produced the lowest RMSE in the best subsets and
        k-fold analysis from our linear model. After playing around with including other predictor variables in the
        neural network we decided to add 2 more for a total of 8 predictor variables. We also adjusted the number of
        hidden layers and neurons in the neural network.
    </p>
    <p>
        We found the neural network with 1 hidden layer and 4 neurons produced the lowest RMSE. Once we determined the
        number of hidden layers to use, we adjusted the size of the sample training data and test data. We found that
        dividing the sample into 80% training data and holding out 20% for the test data allowed the model to produce
        the lowest RMSE.
