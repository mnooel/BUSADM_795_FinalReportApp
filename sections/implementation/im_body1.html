    <h3>Outliers Removal</h3>
    <p>
        We began the implementation of our models by visualizing the time series of monthly income at Core Creative.
        Visualizing the time series provides necessary context for the modelling we are attempting to do. It appears the
        time series is trending up over time and may have a component of seasonality. This is important in determining
        which independent variables are relevant and suggests we should try using indicator variables to model the
        effects of seasonality.

    <p>
        The red line in the time series plot below is a simple linear regression fitted line of monthly income against
        time. This simple regression is not good at explaining or predicting monthly income. Furthermore, there seems to
        be an outlier somewhere around period 64 or 65. We need to identify this month exactly to remove it from our
        data.
