        After removing the outlier from the dataset, we tested for autocorrelations to determine if we need to use a
        lagging predictor variable in the model. The autocorrelation test suggests we use a 1 period lag of income in
        our model. We also tested for autocorrelation using the partial autocorrelation function in R to determine where
        partial autocorrelations for all higher lags are not significant.
