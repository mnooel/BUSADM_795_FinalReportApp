    <h3>Linear Model: Single Lagging Predictor and Indicator Variables</h3>
    <p>
        We used the ‘Hmisc’ package to create a lagging predictor variable for income. Then we created indicator
        variables for each month of the year and included these in our regression model. Once the regression model was
        created, we ran model diagnostics on the residuals. We then plotted the fitted line against the original values
        in the time series to visualize the fit. The independent variables included time(t2), lagged income (income_1),
        and our monthly indicator variables (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov).
