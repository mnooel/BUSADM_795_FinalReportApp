    <h3>Model Building</h3>
    <p>
        Our exploratory analysis indicated that our independent variables have linear relationships to income. The
        strength of the linear relationship varied but we feel it is reasonable to use linear regression. Given that we
        are analyzing a time series we decided to use lagging predictor variables in our analysis as well as indicator
        variables for each month of the year. The indicator variables will help account for seasonality in the time
        series.
    </p>
    <h3>Modeling Technique</h3>
    <p>
        We will use three models to predict monthly income at Core Creative. The models to be used are two linear
        regression models and a neural network. For the first linear regression we will use a single lagging predictor
        variable and indicator variables for each month of the year. The second linear regression will introduce several
        additional lagging variables that are selected based on best subsets analysis. The neural network model will use
        the same variables as the second linear regression model. Below is an overview of the modeling techniques we
        selected.

    <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
    <p>
        The assumptions of linear regression include:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Linear relationship: It is assumed that a linear relationship exists between the dependent and independent variables.</li>
        <li>Independence: There is no correlation between consecutive residuals in time series data.</li>
        <li>Homoscedasticity: The residuals have constant variance at every level of x.</li>
        <li>Normality: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.</li>
    </ol>
