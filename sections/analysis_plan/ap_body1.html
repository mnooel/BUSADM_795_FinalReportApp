    <h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Although the data was gathered using Python, our analysis will be performed using R.
        We begin by importing the income statement time series data into R and checking the structure of the data.
        Next, we plot the independent variables against the dependent variable, income, to get an understanding of the
        relationships in the data.
        During this process we check for outliers or data that needs to be transformed in order to fulfill the
        assumptions of linear regression.
