    <h3>Neural Network Model</h3>
    <p>
        For our analysis and models to be useful we need to have certainty that the assumptions of the modeling
        techniques are adequately met. The first two models we use are based on linear regression. As mentioned above,
        there are four major assumptions that must be met in linear regression <a
            href="https://www.statology.org/linear-regression-assumptions/" target="_blank">
        (Bobbit, 2020)
    </a>. Our implementation of the
        linear regression models relies on model diagnostics to check these assumptions. The next section will
        illustrate that these assumptions were not violated in our analysis. Given this, we believe the linear
        regression models will be reasonable in their application, regardless of their predictive ability.

        Neural networks don’t have the same limitations as linear regression. They impose minimal demands on model
        structure and that may be in part why they are becoming more and more prevalent. However, the number of cases in
        our dataset is relatively small (94) compared to many applications of neural networks which may use tens of
        thousands or a nearly unlimited dataset. This may lead to a neural network that doesn’t have enough training
        data to draw useful conclusions. Indeed, as our analysis will show, the Root Mean Square Error of the neural
        network was higher than the linear models’ RMSE. This high error could be in part due to the limited data we fed
        into the neural network. It could also be a reflection of including the wrong independent variables or not
        enough independent variables in the network.
